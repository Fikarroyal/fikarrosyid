  summary:
    "I am currently pursuing my interest in programming. I enrolled in a programming training and learned machine learning, AI engineering, and iOS developer. My favorite part of programming is being able to get solutions and being able to solve problematic programs. I am also familiar with Python and Swift. I always want to learn new era technologies and want to create new technologies in the future. When I am not coding, I enjoy pushing mobile legend rank, actively interacting on social media, and learning new things.",
